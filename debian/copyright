Comment:
 The source tarball was repacked because it contained files without source
 or software which has already been packaged for Debian. Please use
 debian/rules get-orig-source to retrieve the DFSG compatible sources.
 .
 The Bullet project was started by Erwin Coumans but many other people have
 made a contribution to it in the past. Please refer to the AUTHORS.txt file in
 the source package for more information.
